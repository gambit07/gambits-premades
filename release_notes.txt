- Additions:
  - Opportunity Attacks: Added new DAE flag oaDisadvantageSource. This will cause the actor with the effect to have disadvantage on any opportunity attack they make.
- Updates:
  - Opportunity Attacks: Added guard to prevent opportunity attacks if the OA setting is disabled but for whatever reason a token still has an OA region.
  - Dialogs: Reworked countdown bar animation again because I wasn't happy with it. Should be much more performant via updating to a transform animation that also allows a smoother bar animation
- Bugfixes:
  - Debug Logs: Fixed Unprepared spells not outputting their relevant debug message
  - Elemental Affinity 2024: Fixed damage not applying
  - Black Tentacles 2024: Resolved automation never firing after initial dialog prompt due to an invalid logic gate. Also updated animation to scale properly again
