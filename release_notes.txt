- Updates:
  - Updated a number of spells to use default damage details instead of custom, just a relic of the old days
  - Elemental Affinity: Updated damage roll to add to existing damage roll rather than creating its own in order to not trigger things like extra concentration checks
- Bugfixes:
  - Dialogs: Resolved some bad performance bugs
  - Ice Knife: Updated to work with CPR transmuted spell (I think)
  - Reckless Attack 2024: Updated to prevent dialog if token is not using a strength weapon
